**Pro tip:** Lan Ha Bay (Cat Ba Island side) is less crowded and cheaper than the main Ha Long Bay tourist routes. Some operators combine both. Ask specifically about Lan Ha when booking.

---

## Days 6-7: Hue

The former imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945). Hue is quieter than Hanoi, deeply historical, and has some of the best food in the country.

**Hue daily budget**: 600,000-1,000,000 VND ($24-40).

Vietnam's best-preserved ancient town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a paradise for food, shopping, and lantern-lit evenings.

**Hoi An daily budget**: 800,000-1,500,000 VND ($32-60), higher if tailoring.

---

## Day 10: Da Nang

A short 30-minute drive from Hoi An, [Da Nang](/city/da-nang/) is Vietnam's most livable city with spectacular beaches and the famous Marble Mountains.

- Morning: **Marble Mountains** (40,000 VND entry + 15,000 VND elevator). Climb through caves, temples, and viewpoints. The Huyen Khong Cave is the highlight.

- Afternoon: **Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica** (exterior only, under restoration) and the **Central Post Office** -- a gorgeous French colonial building still functioning as a post office.
- Evening: Explore **Bui Vien Walking Street** for backpacker nightlife, or head to a rooftop bar on Nguyen Hue boulevard for skyline views.

### Day 12: Markets and Local Life
- Morning: **Ben Thanh Market** -- iconic but touristy. Good for souvenirs and dried goods. Bargain hard (start at 40% of asking price).
- Mid-morning: **Chinatown (Cho Lon)** -- Binh Tay Market is less touristy and more authentic than Ben Thanh. Thien Hau Pagoda nearby is stunning.
- Lunch: [Com tam](/food/com-tam/) (broken rice) at Com Tam Ba Ghien (40,000 VND).

---

## Day 13: Mekong Delta Day Trip

The vast river delta south of HCMC is Vietnam's rice bowl -- a water world of floating markets, fruit orchards, and narrow canals.

- **Getting there**: Organized day trips from HCMC start at 500,000 VND ($20) including transport, boat rides, and lunch. Or take a bus to [Can Tho](/city/can-tho/) (3.5 hours, 150,000 VND) and arrange boats locally.
- Early morning: **Cai Rang Floating Market** (from Can Tho) or **Cai Be Floating Market** (closer to HCMC). Farmers sell produce directly from their boats. Arrive before 8 AM for peak activity.

- Lunch: Elephant ear fish (ca tai tuong) -- a Mekong specialty grilled whole and wrapped in rice paper with herbs.
- Afternoon: Return to HCMC.

**Pro tip:** The Mekong Delta deserves more than a day trip. If you have flexibility, spend a night in Can Tho and visit the floating market at dawn independently by hiring a small boat (300,000 VND / $12) -- far better than the tourist group experience.

---

## Day 14: Cu Chi Tunnels

A powerful and fascinating half-day trip to the tunnel network used by Viet Cong fighters during the Vietnam War.

- **Getting there**: Tour buses from HCMC take 1.5 hours. Half-day tours start at 250,000 VND ($10). Or take public bus 13 from Ben Thanh to Cu Chi town and then a xe om (motorbike taxi) to the tunnels.

- Lunch: On-site or back in HCMC.
- Afternoon: Return to HCMC for final shopping, a massage (250,000-400,000 VND for 60 minutes), or simply a last bowl of pho before your departure.

Add **Ninh Binh** (2 days) between Hanoi and Ha Long Bay. The "Ha Long Bay on land" has stunning karst landscapes, ancient temples at Hoa Lu, and boat rides through Tam Coc caves.

### Off the Beaten Path
Swap Ha Long Bay for **Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park** (accessible by train to Dong Hoi, 8 hours from Hanoi). Home to the world's largest cave (Son Doong) and several other spectacular caves at a fraction of Ha Long's crowds.

### Fast-Paced 10-Day Version
Cut Hue (fly Hanoi to Da Nang directly), reduce HCMC to 1 day, and skip one of the day trips.
