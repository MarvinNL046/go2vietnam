# Vietnam E-Visa 2026: Complete Guide to Application, Costs & Processing Times

Getting into Vietnam has never been easier. The **Vietnam e-visa** system allows citizens of 200+ countries to apply for a tourist or business visa entirely online—no embassy visits, no paperwork chaos, no waiting in lines. When we first explored Vietnam in 2022, the e-visa system was relatively new; today in 2026, it's the fastest, cheapest, and most convenient entry method for most international travelers.

This guide walks you through everything you need to know: exact costs in USD and VND, step-by-step application instructions, processing timeframes, and honest answers to the questions we hear most often.

## 1. What Exactly Is a Vietnam E-Visa?

The **Vietnam e-visa** is an official electronic travel authorization issued directly by the Vietnam Immigration Department. It's a legitimate visa—not a tourist card or travel permit—that grants you legal entry to Vietnam for tourism or business purposes. Unlike traditional visas stamped in your passport, the e-visa exists only digitally. When you arrive at the airport or border, you present your approval letter (printed or on your phone) along with your passport, and immigration officers scan it into their system.

During our time in [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/) and [Hanoi](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/hanoi/), we watched hundreds of travelers breeze through immigration with their e-visa approval letters—it's genuinely the smoothest entry process we've seen across Southeast Asia. The system went live in 2017 and has been refined continuously. As of November 2024, Vietnam Immigration migrated to two new official domains: **https://evisa.gov.vn** and **https://thithucdientu.gov.vn**. These are the ONLY legitimate government portals—avoid third-party visa agencies unless you want to pay inflated fees.

### How It Works: The Basic Process

You submit your application online through the official portal, pay the government fee, and receive an approval letter via email within your chosen timeframe. The letter contains a unique reference number and QR code. You print it (or screenshot it) and present it at immigration when you arrive. The visa is valid for 30 days from your entry date, and you can stay in Vietnam for up to 30 days total on a single-entry tourist e-visa.

### Single-Entry vs. Multiple-Entry

The standard e-visa is **single-entry only**—meaning once you leave Vietnam, it's no longer valid. If you plan to leave and re-enter (say, a quick trip to [Cambodia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia) and back), you'll need to apply for a second e-visa. Multiple-entry visas do exist but are typically obtained through Vietnamese embassies abroad, not via the e-visa portal, and are more expensive.

> **Did You Know?** Vietnam's e-visa system processed over 3 million applications in 2023 alone, making it one of Southeast Asia's most-used online visa systems.

## 2. Who Is Eligible to Apply for a Vietnam E-Visa?

The **Vietnam e-visa** is available to citizens of approximately 200+ countries and territories. The official list is maintained on the immigration portal, but in our [experience](https://getyourguide.tpo.lv/GuAFfGGK), most Western countries, Southeast Asian nations, and many others are included. Citizens of a few nations (like North Korea and a handful of others) are not eligible—but this is extremely rare.

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from your intended entry date. If your passport expires sooner, you'll need to renew it before applying. The e-visa is issued to the specific passport number you provide, so if you get a new passport, you'll need a new e-visa.

### Nationality Restrictions

Before you begin the application, verify your country's eligibility on the official portal. The list changes occasionally, but it's comprehensive. If you're unsure, contact the immigration department directly via their website—they respond within 24 hours typically.

### Passport Requirements

Your passport must have:
- **At least 6 months validity** remaining from your entry date
- **At least one blank page** for entry stamps
- **A clear, readable biographical page** (the page with your photo and personal details)

If your passport is damaged, expired, or nearly expired, renew it before applying for the e-visa. This is non-negotiable.

## 3. E-Visa Costs: Exact Pricing for 2026

Here's where the e-visa shines—it's genuinely affordable. The official government fee is straightforward, with no hidden charges if you apply directly through the official portal.

### Official Government Fees (Direct Application)

| Processing Speed | Cost (USD) | Cost (VND) | Timeline |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Standard** | $25 | ~600,000 | 3 business days |
| **Rush** | $8 | ~190,000 | 1 business day |
| **Super Rush** | $5 | ~120,000 | Same day (within 2 hours) |

These prices are fixed by the Vietnam Immigration Department and do not change. Payment is made online via credit/debit card (Visa, Mastercard, JCB accepted). The portal charges in USD, but if you're paying from a non-USD account, your bank will handle the currency conversion.

### Third-Party Service Fees (Avoid Unless Necessary)

Numerous travel agencies and visa service websites advertise Vietnam e-visa applications. They typically charge **$35–$60** for the same service. Why? They're adding their own markup on top of the government fee. Unless you have a specific reason (language barrier, technical issues, or extreme time pressure), apply directly through the official portal and save the money.

We've used third-party services before when traveling with elderly relatives who weren't comfortable with online applications—the convenience was worth the extra cost. But for most travelers, the official portal is straightforward enough.

<div style="background:#FEF3C7;border-left:4px solid #F59E0B;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

## 4. Step-by-Step Application Process

Applying for a **Vietnam e-visa** takes about 10–15 minutes if you have all your documents ready. Here's exactly how to do it:

### Before You Start: Gather Your Documents

You'll need:
- **Valid passport** (with 6+ months validity)
- **Passport photo** (digital file, 4×6 cm, white background, taken within 6 months)
- **Email address** (where your approval letter will be sent)
- **Credit/debit card** (for payment)

The passport photo is critical. It must be:
- Clear and in color
- White or light background
- Face centered, neutral expression
- No glasses, hats, or head coverings (unless religious)
- Taken within the last 6 months
- In JPG or PNG format, under 1 MB

If your photo doesn't meet requirements, the portal will reject it. We recommend using a professional photo booth or having a local photographer take one—it costs only a few dollars and saves rejection headaches.

### The Application Steps

**Step 1: Visit the Official Portal**

Go to **https://evisa.gov.vn** or **https://thithucdientu.gov.vn** (both are official; use whichever loads faster). You'll see the homepage with an application form.

**Step 2: Select Visa Type**

Choose between:
- **Tourist e-visa** (most common; allows tourism activities)
- **Business e-visa** (for business meetings, conferences, work-related travel)

For most travelers, select "Tourist."

**Step 3: Fill in Personal Information**

- Full name (as it appears in your passport)
- Date of birth
- Nationality
- Passport number
- Passport issue and expiration dates
- Gender
- Email address (double-check this—your approval letter goes here)
- Phone number (optional but recommended)

**Step 4: Upload Passport Photo**

Click the photo upload field and select your digital passport photo. The system will verify it meets size and quality requirements. If it's rejected, adjust the photo and try again.

**Step 5: Select Processing Speed**

Choose your timeframe:
- **Standard (3 business days)**: Best for most travelers; cheapest option
- **Rush (1 business day)**: For travelers arriving soon
- **Super Rush (same day)**: For emergency situations

**Step 6: Review and Pay**

Review all information for accuracy—any errors here will cause problems at immigration. Select your payment method (Visa, Mastercard, or JCB) and complete the transaction. You'll receive a payment confirmation email immediately.

**Step 7: Check Your Email**

Your approval letter will arrive within your chosen timeframe. It's a PDF file with your reference number, QR code, and personal details. Download it, save it, and print a copy (or screenshot it for your phone).

## 5. Processing Times Explained

**Processing time** is how long it takes from payment to receiving your approval letter. This is different from how long the visa is valid (30 days from entry).

### Standard Processing (3 Business Days)

This is the most popular option. You apply on a Monday, and you'll typically receive your approval letter by Thursday. "Business days" means Monday–Friday, excluding Vietnamese public holidays. If you apply on Friday, the clock starts Monday. If you apply during Tet (Lunar New Year, typically late January/early February), add extra days—the immigration office is closed.

**Best for:** Travelers with flexible schedules, those booking trips 2+ weeks in advance.

### Rush Processing (1 Business Day)

You apply in the morning, and your approval letter arrives by the next business day. This is ideal for travelers who booked their trip [last-minute](https://booking.tpo.lv/pDNjHJA1) but still have a few days before arrival.

**Best for:** Last-minute bookings, travelers arriving within 48 hours.

### Super Rush (Same Day)

You apply, and your approval letter arrives within 2 hours. This is genuinely fast—we've seen it work flawlessly. However, it's the most expensive option and should only be used for genuine emergencies.

**Best for:** Unexpected trips, visa rejections from other countries, emergency travel.

### Important Timing Notes

- Applications submitted on weekends or Vietnamese public holidays are processed the next business day
- Vietnamese public holidays include: Tet (late January–early February), Hung Kings' Festival (April), National Day (September 2), and others
- If your approval letter arrives on a Friday evening, you can still use it for a Monday arrival—the visa is valid from your entry date, not the approval date

During our time in Vietnam, we've seen travelers panic about processing times unnecessarily. The standard 3-day option is genuinely reliable. Only upgrade to rush/super rush if you're genuinely cutting it close.

## 6. What to Do When Your Approval Letter Arrives

Once you receive your approval letter via email, here's what you need to know:

### Printing vs. Digital


<div data-widget-fallback style="background:#F0FDF4;border-left:4px solid #22C55E;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:16px;">
    <div style="flex:1;">
      <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;margin-bottom:8px;">
        <span style="font-size:28px;line-height:1;">🎒</span>
        <strong style="font-size:18px;color:#1F2937;">Book Tours & Activities</strong>
      </div>
      <p style="color:#4B5563;margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:15px;line-height:1.5;">Skip the hassle — book Vietnam day trips, cooking classes, and experiences in advance with instant confirmation.</p>
      <a href="https://klook.tpo.lv/7Dt6WApj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" style="display:inline-block;background:#16A34A;color:white;padding:10px 20px;border-radius:8px;text-decoration:none;font-weight:600;font-size:14px;">Browse Activities on Klook →</a>
    </div>
    <a href="https://klook.tpo.lv/7Dt6WApj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" style="flex-shrink:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;">
      <img src="/images/qrcodes/qrcode-klook.jpeg" alt="Scan to visit Book Tours & Activities" style="width:72px;height:72px;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid #22C55E33;" />
      <span style="display:block;font-size:10px;color:#6B7280;margin-top:4px;">Scan me</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>


You can either:
- **Print the approval letter** on regular paper (color or black-and-white both work)
- **Show it digitally** on your phone/tablet (screenshot or PDF viewer)

We recommend printing a copy anyway—it's a backup in case your phone dies or you encounter a tech-savvy immigration officer who prefers paper. Printing costs nothing at most hotels or internet cafes.

### What's in the Letter

Your approval letter includes:
- Your reference number (unique identifier)
- QR code (scanned at immigration)
- Your personal details (name, passport number, DOB)
- Visa type and validity period
- Entry/exit dates

Double-check all details. If anything is wrong (misspelled name, wrong passport number), contact the immigration department immediately via the portal's support email. Errors can cause entry denial.

### Validity Period

Your e-visa is valid for **30 days from your entry date**. This means:
- You can enter Vietnam anytime within 30 days of approval
- Once you enter, you can stay for up to 30 days
- If you don't enter within 30 days, the visa expires and you'll need to apply again

For example: If your approval letter arrives on February 1st, you can enter Vietnam anytime between February 1st and March 2nd. Once you enter on, say, February 15th, you can stay until March 16th.

## 7. Entry Points: Where You Can Use Your E-Visa

The **Vietnam e-visa** is accepted at most major airports and land borders, but NOT all. Here's the breakdown:

### Airports (All Accept E-Visa)

- **Hanoi (Noi Bai International Airport)** – Northern entry point
- **Ho Chi Minh City (Tan Son Nhat International Airport)** – Southern entry point
- **Da Nang International Airport** – Central coast entry point
- **Can Tho International Airport** – Mekong Delta entry point
- **Phu Quoc International Airport** – Island entry point
- **Hai Phong International Airport** – Northern coast entry point

All international airports accept e-visas. This is the most common entry method.

### Land Borders (Selective)

E-visas are accepted at some, but NOT all, land borders:
- **Moc Bai** (Cambodia border, near [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/))
- **Ha Tien** (Cambodia border, Mekong Delta)
- **Cau Treo** (Laos border, central Vietnam)
- **Vientiane–Nong Khai** (Laos border, northern [Hanoi](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/hanoi/) region)

However, some smaller land borders do NOT accept e-visas. If you're entering by land, confirm your specific border crossing accepts e-visas before you travel. The official portal lists all accepted entry points.

### Sea Ports (Limited)

E-visas are accepted at:
- **Ho Chi Minh City Port** (cruise ship arrivals)
- **Hai Phong Port** (northern cruise arrivals)

If you're arriving by cruise, verify your port of call accepts e-visas.

### Where E-Visas Are NOT Accepted

- Small/remote land borders
- Some river crossings
- Unofficial border crossings

If you're planning an overland trip through Southeast Asia, stick to major border crossings and verify in advance.

## 8. Common Problems and How to Avoid Them

In our experience helping travelers navigate Vietnam visas, we've seen the same mistakes repeatedly. Here's how to avoid them:

### Problem 1: Photo Rejection

**What happens:** You upload a photo, and the system rejects it as "not meeting requirements."

**Why:** Background isn't white, photo is too old, file is too large, or face isn't centered.

**Solution:** Use a professional photo booth photo or have a photographer take one. Ensure white background, clear face, and recent date. Keep file under 1 MB.

### Problem 2: Passport Number Errors

**What happens:** You enter your passport number incorrectly, receive approval, and immigration denies entry because the numbers don't match.

**Why:** Typos happen—especially with long passport numbers.

**Solution:** Copy-paste your passport number directly from your passport. Don't type it manually. Double-check before submitting.

### Problem 3: Expired Passport

**What happens:** You apply with a passport expiring in 4 months, approval arrives, but by the time you travel, your passport is within 6 months of expiration.

**Why:** You didn't account for processing time + travel date + the 6-month validity requirement.

**Solution:** Renew your passport BEFORE applying if it expires within 9 months. The 6-month rule is strict.

### Problem 4: Missing the 30-Day Window

**What happens:** Your approval letter arrives, but you don't enter Vietnam within 30 days, and now it's expired.

**Why:** You booked your trip loosely and didn't track the approval date.

**Solution:** Apply only when you have confirmed travel dates. Set a phone reminder for day 25 if you're cutting it close.

### Problem 5: Applying Through Fake Websites

**What happens:** You pay $50 to a website that looks official, and your application never reaches the real immigration department.

**Why:** Scam websites are common. They look legitimate but are just middlemen stealing your money.

**Solution:** ONLY use **https://evisa.gov.vn** or **https://thithucdientu.gov.vn**. Bookmark these URLs. If a website asks for more than $25 (standard), it's not official.

> **Did You Know?** Fake visa websites cost travelers millions annually. The official portal is the only legitimate source—anything else is a scam.

You can extend your tourist visa by **30 days** (sometimes longer) through immigration offices in major cities:

- **Hanoi Immigration Office** – Handles extensions for northern Vietnam
- **Ho Chi Minh City Immigration Office** – Handles extensions for southern Vietnam
- **Da Nang Immigration Office** – Handles extensions for central Vietnam

**Cost:** Approximately 1.2–1.5 million VND (~$50–$60 USD) for a 30-day extension.

**Timeline:** 3–5 business days.

**Process:** Visit the office in person with your passport, completed form, and passport photo. Many hotels and travel agencies can arrange this for you—they'll handle the paperwork for a small fee.

### Visa Run (Leave and Re-Enter)

Alternatively, you can leave Vietnam before your 30 days expire and apply for a new e-visa to re-enter. Many travelers do this to visit [Cambodia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia) or [Laos](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/laos) and return. Simply apply for a second e-visa using the same process.

**Cost:** $25 (standard) for a new e-visa.

**Best for:** Travelers wanting to explore neighboring countries.

### Multiple-Entry Visa (Embassy Route)

If you plan multiple entries and want to avoid repeated applications, apply for a multiple-entry visa through a Vietnamese embassy before you travel. These are more expensive ($100+) but valid for 3–12 months with unlimited entries.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I apply for a Vietnam e-visa if I'm already in Vietnam?

No. The e-visa must be applied for before you enter Vietnam. If you're already in the country and need to extend, use the visa extension process through immigration offices instead.

### What if my approval letter gets lost or deleted?

Contact the immigration department with your reference number, and they'll resend it. Keep your confirmation email from payment—it contains your reference number. You can also log into the portal and download your approval letter again if you have the reference number.

### Can I change my entry date after approval?

No. The approval letter is tied to your passport and visa type. If your travel dates change, you'll need to apply for a new e-visa. The old one becomes invalid once you apply for a new one.

### Is the e-visa valid for the entire 30 days, or do I need to enter by a specific date?

You must **enter Vietnam within 30 days of approval**. Once you enter, you can stay for up to 30 days from your entry date. So if approved on February 1st, you can enter anytime between February 1st–March 2nd, and then stay until 30 days after your actual entry date.

### What happens if I overstay my visa?

Overstaying results in fines (approximately 100,000 VND per day, or ~$4 USD per day) and potential deportation. It's not worth it. If you need to stay longer, extend your visa before it expires.

### Can I work on a tourist e-visa?

No. The tourist e-visa is strictly for tourism. If you're working, you need a business visa or work permit. Immigration takes this seriously—violations can result in deportation and bans on re-entry.

### Do I need travel insurance with an e-visa?

The e-visa doesn't require it, but we strongly recommend [travel insurance](https://go2-vietnam.com/travel-insurance/) anyway. It covers medical emergencies, flight cancellations, and lost luggage—invaluable in any country.
