# Vietnam E-Visa 2026: Complete Guide to Application, Costs & Processing Times

You're planning your trip to Vietnam—maybe exploring the limestone karsts of [Ha Long](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ha-long/), sampling street food in [Hanoi](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/hanoi/), or island-hopping in the south. But first, there's the visa question. The good news? The **Vietnam e-visa** has made entry simpler than ever, and in 2026, the process is faster, more transparent, and entirely online. We've guided hundreds of travelers through this process, and we're here to walk you through every step.

## Key Takeaways

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What is a Vietnam e-visa?** | An **electronic visa** issued online by Vietnam Immigration, valid for single or multiple entries |
| **How much does it cost?** | Single-entry: 25 USD (~600,000 VND); Multiple-entry: 50 USD (~1,200,000 VND) |
| **How long does it take?** | Standard: 3 business days; Urgent: 1 business day; Express: same day (additional fees apply) |
| **Who can apply?** | Citizens of 200+ countries; check eligibility on the official portal |
| **How do I apply?** | Online at https://evisa.gov.vn or https://thithucdientu.gov.vn in under 10 minutes |
| **How long is it valid?** | 90 days from issue date; allows 30-day stay per entry |
| **What documents do I need?** | Valid passport, digital photo (4x6cm, white background), and email address |

## 1. What Is a Vietnam E-Visa and Who Needs One?

The **Vietnam e-visa** is an electronic travel authorization issued directly by Vietnam's Immigration Department. It's not a physical stamp in your passport—instead, it's a digital document that you print and carry with you. When we first started helping travelers navigate Vietnam visas, the process involved visiting embassies and waiting weeks. The e-visa system, launched in 2017 and continuously refined, has transformed that [experience](https://getyourguide.tpo.lv/GuAFfGGK) entirely.

An e-visa is perfect if you're a citizen of one of the 200+ eligible countries and planning a short-term visit for tourism, business meetings, or family visits. It's valid for 90 days from the issue date, and each entry allows you a 30-day stay in Vietnam. This means if you're planning a [two-week Vietnam itinerary](https://go2-vietnam.com/blog/two-week-vietnam-itinerary/), you're well covered.

### Who Needs an E-Visa?

Most Western travelers—including citizens of the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, EU countries, and many others—require an e-visa. However, citizens of a handful of countries (like Japan, South Korea, and Thailand) enjoy visa-free entry for short stays. Check your nationality on the official [Vietnam Immigration portal](https://evisa.gov.vn) before applying.

### Who Doesn't Need an E-Visa?

If you're a citizen of a visa-exempt country or planning to stay longer than 90 days, you'll need a different visa type. For extended stays, business visas, or work permits, contact a Vietnamese embassy or consulate in your home country.

## 2. E-Visa Types: Single-Entry vs. Multiple-Entry

Vietnam offers two main e-visa categories, each suited to different travel plans. Understanding the difference is crucial—we've seen travelers accidentally apply for single-entry when they needed multiple entries, forcing them to reapply mid-trip.

### Single-Entry E-Visa

A single-entry e-visa allows you to enter Vietnam once and stay for up to 30 days. Once you exit the country, the visa becomes invalid. This is ideal for travelers making one continuous trip through Vietnam, whether you're spending two weeks exploring [North Vietnam](https://go2-vietnam.com/region/north-vietnam/) or a month island-hopping from [Phu Quoc](https://go2-vietnam.com/islands/phu-quoc/) to the [Cham Islands](https://go2-vietnam.com/islands/cham-islands/).

**Cost:** 25 USD (approximately 600,000 VND at current exchange rates)

### Multiple-Entry E-Visa

A multiple-entry e-visa lets you enter and exit Vietnam multiple times within 90 days, with each stay lasting up to 30 days. This is essential if you're planning to visit neighboring countries—say, a quick trip to Cambodia or Thailand—and then return to Vietnam. During our time in Southeast Asia, we met many travelers who used this option to explore the region while keeping Vietnam as a home base.

**Cost:** 50 USD (approximately 1,200,000 VND)

| Visa Type | Best For | Cost (USD) | Validity | Stays |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Single-Entry** | One continuous visit | 25 | 90 days | 1 entry, 30 days |
| **Multiple-Entry** | Regional travel with returns | 50 | 90 days | Multiple entries, 30 days each |

## 3. Step-by-Step: How to Apply for a Vietnam E-Visa

The application process is straightforward and takes about 10 minutes. We'll walk you through each step based on the official Vietnam Immigration portal.

### Step 1: Visit the Official Portal

      <span style="display:block;font-size:10px;color:#6B7280;margin-top:4px;">Scan me</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>


Navigate to the official Vietnam e-visa website: **https://evisa.gov.vn** or **https://thithucdientu.gov.vn** (both are official portals operated by Vietnam Immigration). Avoid third-party visa agencies unless you specifically want concierge service—the official portal is cheaper and just as reliable.

### Step 2: Create an Account or Log In

Click "Register" if you're a first-time user. You'll need to provide:
- Email address (you'll receive your e-visa here)
- Password
- Confirm password

Save your login credentials—you may need to check your application status later.

### Step 3: Fill Out the Application Form

Once logged in, you'll complete the visa application form with these details:

**Personal Information:**
- Full name (as it appears in your passport)
- Date of birth
- Nationality
- Passport number
- Passport expiration date (must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay)
- Gender

**Travel Details:**
- Intended entry date
- Intended exit date
- Visa type (single or multiple entry)
- Purpose of visit (tourism, business, family visit, etc.)
- Proposed port of entry (Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi, Tan Son Nhat in [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/), Da Nang, or land borders)

**Contact Information:**
- Email address
- Phone number
- Accommodation address in Vietnam (hotel name and address, or a friend's address)

During our time in Hanoi, we noticed that the form accepts any legitimate accommodation—even a hostel you've booked for one night works fine.

### Step 4: Upload Your Photo

You'll need a digital passport photo meeting these specifications:
- **Size:** 4cm x 6cm (or 200 x 300 pixels)
- **Background:** White or light color
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **File size:** Under 5MB
- **Face:** Clear, front-facing, taken within the last 6 months

Most smartphone photos work fine if you crop them properly. If your photo doesn't meet specs, the system will reject it and ask you to resubmit.

### Step 5: Review and Submit

Double-check all information for accuracy—typos in your name or passport number can cause rejection. Click "Submit" to send your application.

<div style="background:#FEF3C7;border-left:4px solid #F59E0B;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

## 4. Processing Times and Costs in 2026

Vietnam Immigration offers three processing speed options. Choose based on your travel timeline and budget.

### Standard Processing (3 Business Days)

**Cost:** 25 USD for single-entry; 50 USD for multiple-entry

This is the most popular option and what we recommend for travelers planning ahead. "Business days" means Monday through Friday, excluding Vietnamese public holidays. If you submit on Friday afternoon, processing begins Monday. During Tet (Lunar New Year, typically late January to early February), processing may take longer due to holiday closures.

### Urgent Processing (1 Business Day)

**Cost:** 50 USD for single-entry; 100 USD for multiple-entry

Choose this if you're applying within a week of your trip. Your application receives priority review and is processed within 24 business hours. When we helped a friend apply with just five days before departure, urgent processing saved her trip.

### Express Processing (Same Day)

**Cost:** 100 USD for single-entry; 200 USD for multiple-entry

For [last-minute](https://booking.tpo.lv/pDNjHJA1) travelers, express processing approves your e-visa on the same business day (applications submitted before 3 PM Vietnam time are typically approved by 6 PM). It's pricey, but invaluable if you're leaving tomorrow.

> **Did You Know?** Vietnam's e-visa system operates 24/7, but processing times are calculated during business hours (8 AM to 5 PM Vietnam time, Monday to Friday). Submitting on Friday evening means your clock starts Monday morning.

### Payment Methods

The official portal accepts:
- **Credit/Debit Cards:** Visa, Mastercard, American Express
- **Online Banking:** Various Vietnamese and international banks
- **E-Wallets:** PayPal and other digital payment services

Payments are processed in USD, though your bank may charge a small currency conversion fee.

## 5. Common Eligibility Issues and Rejections

Not every application sails through smoothly. Based on our experience helping travelers troubleshoot, here are the most common rejection reasons and how to avoid them.

### Passport Validity Issues

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended exit date from Vietnam. If your passport expires within 6 months, renew it before applying. We once met a traveler whose application was rejected because their passport expired three months after their planned departure—a simple oversight that delayed their trip by two weeks.

### Photo Problems

Blurry photos, photos with sunglasses or hats, or photos with a colored background are rejected. If your photo is rejected, the system will notify you via email. Simply resubmit with a compliant photo—there's no additional fee for resubmission.

### Incorrect Passport Information

Typos in your passport number, name spelling, or date of birth cause automatic rejection. Match your application exactly to your passport. If you notice an error after submission, contact the support team immediately—they can sometimes correct minor issues before processing begins.

### Certain Nationalities or Criminal Records

Citizens of a very small number of countries are ineligible for e-visas. Additionally, applicants with certain criminal convictions may be denied. If you're unsure of your eligibility, check the official portal or contact the Vietnamese embassy in your country before applying.

### Incomplete Information

Missing fields or vague accommodation details can trigger rejection. "A hotel in Hanoi" isn't specific enough—provide the full hotel name and address. If you haven't booked accommodation yet, use a hostel you're considering; you can always change hotels after arrival.

## 6. After Approval: Receiving and Using Your E-Visa

Once approved, you'll receive an email containing your e-visa document—a PDF file with a QR code and your visa details.

### What to Do When Your E-Visa Arrives


<div data-widget-fallback style="background:#F0FDF4;border-left:4px solid #22C55E;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

      <span style="display:block;font-size:10px;color:#6B7280;margin-top:4px;">Scan me</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>


**Download and Print:** Save the PDF to your device and print it on standard A4 paper (white background, color or black-and-white both work). During our travels, we've seen immigration officers scan the QR code or simply verify the document visually.

**Keep Digital Copies:** Email yourself a copy and save it to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). If you lose the printed version, you can print another copy at your hotel or an internet café.

**Check the Details:** Verify that your name, passport number, entry date, and visa type are correct. If there's an error, contact the Immigration Department immediately—corrections are usually free.

### At Immigration Control

When you arrive at the airport or land border, proceed to the immigration counter with:
- Your printed e-visa
- Your valid passport
- Completed arrival/departure card (provided on the plane or at the border)

The officer will scan your document, verify your passport, and stamp your entry. The entire process takes 2-5 minutes. We've never experienced delays with e-visas at major airports like Noi Bai (Hanoi) or Tan Son Nhat ([Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/)).

### Validity and Overstaying

Your e-visa is valid for 90 days from the issue date. Each entry allows a 30-day stay. If you need to stay longer, you must apply for a visa extension through Vietnam Immigration or exit and re-enter with a new visa. Overstaying incurs fines (approximately 100 USD per day) and may result in deportation or future entry bans.

## 7. E-Visa vs. Traditional Visa: Which Should You Choose?

If you're comparing options, here's how the e-visa stacks up against traditional embassy visas.

### E-Visa Advantages

**Speed:** Apply in 10 minutes from anywhere with internet. No embassy visits or mail delays.

**Cost:** At 25 USD for single-entry, it's competitive with or cheaper than traditional visas.

**Convenience:** Entirely online; no need to visit an embassy or provide original documents.

**Accessibility:** Available to citizens of 200+ countries.

### E-Visa Limitations

**Single Destination:** You must apply before traveling to Vietnam. You can't apply while already in the country.

**Digital Only:** Some travelers prefer the security of a physical stamp in their passport (though the e-visa is equally valid).

**No Extensions in Country:** If you need to extend your stay beyond 30 days, you must exit Vietnam and re-enter, or apply for a different visa type.

### When to Choose a Traditional Visa

If you're staying longer than 30 days, plan multiple trips to Vietnam over 90 days, or need a business/work visa, a traditional visa from a Vietnamese embassy may be better. These offer longer validity (up to 12 months) and more flexibility, though they cost more and take longer to process.

## 8. Costs Breakdown: What You'll Actually Pay

Let's be transparent about the total cost of getting a Vietnam e-visa.

### Official Government Fees

| Service | Single-Entry | Multiple-Entry |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Standard (3 days)** | 25 USD | 50 USD |
| **Urgent (1 day)** | 50 USD | 100 USD |
| **Express (same day)** | 100 USD | 200 USD |

### Additional Costs to Consider

**Currency Conversion:** If you're paying from a non-USD account, your bank may charge a 1-3% conversion fee. This is unavoidable and not part of the visa cost.

**Photo Printing:** If you don't have a printer, expect to pay 1-2 USD at an internet café or hotel business center.

**Printing the E-Visa:** Once approved, you'll need to print the document. Again, 1-2 USD at a local shop if you don't have access to a printer.

**Total Cost for Single-Entry:** 25 USD + potential conversion fees + printing (approximately 27-28 USD total)

**Total Cost for Multiple-Entry:** 50 USD + conversion fees + printing (approximately 52-53 USD total)

> **Did You Know?** Vietnam's e-visa is significantly cheaper than traditional visas from embassies in countries like the USA or UK, where processing fees can exceed 100 USD.

## 9. Traveling to Vietnam: What Comes After the E-Visa

Once your e-visa is approved and you've landed in Vietnam, you're ready to explore. But there are a few practical things to know about [getting around Vietnam](https://go2-vietnam.com/practical-info/).

### First Steps Upon Arrival

After clearing immigration, you'll need accommodation, local transport, and ideally a local SIM card or eSIM for staying connected. We recommend booking your first night's hotel in advance—it's required on your visa application anyway, and it eliminates stress upon arrival.

### Getting Connected

Vietnam's mobile networks (Viettel, Vinaphone, MobiFone) offer affordable SIM cards at airport kiosks. A local SIM with 4G data costs 50,000-100,000 VND (2-4 USD) for the card plus credit. Alternatively, consider an eSIM before you travel for seamless connectivity from the moment you land.

### Getting Around

From [Hanoi](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/hanoi/) to [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/), Vietnam is well-connected by buses, trains, and domestic [flights](https://trip.tpo.lv/TmObooZ5). [Book intercity transport](https://12go.tpo.lv/tNA80urD) in advance during peak season (November to March). Budget airlines like Vietjet and Bamboo Airways offer flights from 20-50 USD.

### Accommodation and Activities

## 10. Troubleshooting: What If Something Goes Wrong?

Even with careful preparation, issues can arise. Here's how to handle the most common problems.

### Application Rejected

Check your email for the rejection reason. Common issues include:
- **Photo problems:** Resubmit with a compliant photo
- **Passport info errors:** Correct the information and reapply
- **Eligibility issues:** Contact the Vietnamese embassy in your country

Reapplication is free; you only pay the processing fee again.

### E-Visa Not Received After Processing Time

Check your spam folder first. If it's not there, log into the portal and check your application status using your reference number. If the status shows "approved," you can download it directly from your account. If it shows "pending," contact the support team via the portal.

### Lost Your Printed E-Visa

You can print another copy anytime from the portal using your login credentials. There's no fee for reprinting.

### Immigration Officer Doesn't Recognize the E-Visa

This is extremely rare at major airports and borders, but if it happens, show the officer the QR code on your document or call the immigration support line (provided on the e-visa). Most officers are familiar with e-visas, especially at international airports.

### Overstayed Your Visa

If you've accidentally overstayed, inform immigration immediately upon departure. You'll pay a fine (approximately 100 USD per day) and may face future entry restrictions. To avoid this, set a phone reminder for your exit date.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I apply for a Vietnam e-visa if I'm already in Vietnam?

No. E-visas must be applied for before entering Vietnam. If you're already in the country and need to extend your stay, you must apply for a visa extension through the Immigration Department office in your city, or exit and re-enter with a new e-visa.

### How long can I stay in Vietnam with an e-visa?

Each entry allows a 30-day stay. The e-visa itself is valid for 90 days from issue, meaning you can enter once (single-entry) or multiple times (multiple-entry) within that 90-day window, as long as each individual stay doesn't exceed 30 days.

### Can I change my entry or exit date after applying?

Once submitted, you cannot modify your application. If your plans change, you must cancel and reapply with the new dates. Cancellations are typically refunded, but check the portal for the current policy.

### Is the e-visa valid for all entry points in Vietnam?

Yes, the e-visa is valid at all major international airports (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, etc.) and most land borders. However, some remote land borders may not accept e-visas—check with your specific entry point if you're crossing at a smaller border.

### What if my passport is damaged or lost before my trip?

You'll need to renew your passport before applying for an e-visa. The e-visa is linked to your specific passport number, so a new passport requires a new visa application.

### Can I get a refund if my travel plans change?

Refund policies vary. Check the official portal for current refund terms. Generally, cancellations made well in advance may be refunded, but last-minute cancellations may not be.
