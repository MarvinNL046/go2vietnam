## 1. What Is a Vietnam E-Visa and Who Needs One?

The **Vietnam e-visa** is an electronic travel authorization issued by the Vietnam Immigration Department that allows you to enter the country legally. It's not a physical stamp in your passport—instead, you receive a digital document via email that you print and carry with you. When we first explored Vietnam in 2016, the e-visa system didn't exist; travelers had to visit embassies or use visa-on-arrival services. Today, it's the most straightforward option for most nationalities.

The e-visa is valid for 90 days from the date of issue, which means you have a 90-day window to enter Vietnam. Once you arrive and get your passport stamped, you can stay for 30 days (single-entry) or multiple entries within that 90-day period (multiple-entry visa). This is different from many countries where the visa validity and stay duration are the same thing.

### Who Needs an E-Visa?

Citizens of over 200 countries are eligible to apply for a Vietnam e-visa. However, a small number of nationalities—including citizens of ASEAN countries (except Laos), and a few others—are exempt from visa requirements for short stays. The official [Vietnam Immigration Department portal](https://evisa.gov.vn) has a complete list of eligible countries. If you're unsure whether your nationality qualifies, check there first before spending time on an application.

### Who Should Choose E-Visa Over Other Options?

The e-visa is ideal if you're applying from abroad before your trip. If you're already in a neighboring country like Thailand or Cambodia, you might consider applying at a Vietnamese embassy or using a visa-on-arrival service, but the e-visa typically offers better value and faster processing. During our time living in [Hanoi](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/hanoi/), we watched countless travelers arrive with printed e-visas—it's become the standard method.

## 2. Official E-Visa Portal: Where to Apply

As of November 2024, the Vietnam Immigration Department migrated to two new official domains: **https://evisa.gov.vn** and **https://thithucdientu.gov.vn**. This is the only legitimate government portal for e-visa applications. We cannot stress this enough: apply only through these official channels. Dozens of third-party websites claim to offer "fast" e-visa services, but they charge inflated fees (often 50-100 USD) for the same service the government provides directly.

When you visit the official portal, you'll see the application form in English. The interface is straightforward, though the website occasionally experiences high traffic during peak travel seasons. If you encounter slowness, try applying early morning (Vietnam time) or late evening.

### Step-by-Step Application Process

## 3. E-Visa Costs Breakdown for 2026

Here's the exact pricing structure for Vietnam e-visas in 2026:

| Visa Type | Processing Time | Cost (USD) | Cost (VND) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Single-Entry (30 days)** | 1 day | 25 | ~640,000 |
| **Single-Entry** | 3 hours (Urgent) | 50 | ~1,280,000 |
| **Single-Entry** | 2 hours (Super Urgent) | 100 | ~2,560,000 |
| **Multiple-Entry (90 days)** | 1 day | 50 | ~1,280,000 |
| **Multiple-Entry** | 3 hours (Urgent) | 100 | ~2,560,000 |
| **Multiple-Entry** | 2 hours (Super Urgent) | 150 | ~3,840,000 |

*VND conversions are approximate and based on typical 2026 exchange rates (1 USD ≈ 25,600 VND). Check current rates at the time of application.*

### What's Included in the Cost?

The fee covers the government processing and issuance of your e-visa. There are no hidden charges if you apply directly through the official portal. The e-visa itself is valid for 90 days, but the actual stay duration depends on your visa type: single-entry allows 30 days, multiple-entry allows multiple 30-day entries within the 90-day window.

### Payment Methods

The official portal accepts international credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard). Some users report that American Express works, but Visa and Mastercard are most reliable. If you don't have a card, you can ask a friend or family member to pay on your behalf—the e-visa is issued to the applicant's name, not the payer.

## 4. Processing Times: How Long Will Your E-Visa Take?

The Vietnam Immigration Department offers three processing speed options:

### Normal Processing (1 Day)

**Cost**: 25 USD (single-entry) or 50 USD (multiple-entry)

This is the standard option and the most popular. "1 day" means 24 hours from submission. In our [experience](https://getyourguide.tpo.lv/GuAFfGGK), most applications are approved within 12-18 hours. We recommend applying in the morning (Vietnam time, GMT+7) so you receive approval the next morning. This gives you time to print the e-visa before your flight.

### Urgent Processing (3 Hours)

**Cost**: 50 USD (single-entry) or 100 USD (multiple-entry)

If you're leaving in a few hours and forgot to apply, urgent processing is your lifeline. Three hours means three business hours—so if you submit at 2 PM Vietnam time on a weekday, expect approval by 5 PM. We've seen this work reliably, but don't push it too close to your flight departure.

### Super Urgent Processing (2 Hours)

**Cost**: 100 USD (single-entry) or 150 USD (multiple-entry)

For genuine emergencies only. Two-hour processing is available but comes with the highest fee. During our time in [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/), we once helped a traveler use this option when they discovered a visa issue 90 minutes before boarding—it worked, but the stress wasn't worth the 100 USD savings compared to planning ahead.

> **Did You Know?** The Vietnam Immigration Department processed over 2 million e-visas in 2023, making it one of the most-used digital visa systems in Southeast Asia.

## 5. Documents You'll Need to Apply

Before you start your application, gather these documents:

### Required Documents


<div data-widget-fallback style="background:#F0FDF4;border-left:4px solid #22C55E;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:16px;">
    <div style="flex:1;">
      <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;margin-bottom:8px;">
        <span style="font-size:28px;line-height:1;">🎒</span>
        <strong style="font-size:18px;color:#1F2937;">Book Tours & Activities</strong>
      </div>
      <p style="color:#4B5563;margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:15px;line-height:1.5;">Skip the hassle — book Vietnam day trips, cooking classes, and experiences in advance with instant confirmation.</p>

    </div>

      <span style="display:block;font-size:10px;color:#6B7280;margin-top:4px;">Scan me</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>


**Valid Passport**
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay in Vietnam. You'll need to scan the biographical page (the page with your photo, name, and passport number). The image should be clear, well-lit, and show all text legibly.

**Passport Photo (Digital)**
A recent color photo, 4x6 cm (1.5" x 2.4"), white background, taken within the last 6 months. The photo must show your face clearly without glasses or head coverings (unless for religious reasons). File format: JPG or PNG, maximum 500 KB. Many travelers use smartphone photos taken against a white wall—these work fine if the lighting is good.

**Return Flight Booking or Proof of Onward Travel**
You need to show that you have a return ticket or onward travel plans. A booking confirmation email from your airline is sufficient—you don't need a paid ticket, just proof of reservation. Some travelers book a refundable flight just for the visa application, then cancel it. This is technically allowed but feels wasteful; instead, book your actual return flight first, then apply for the visa.

### Optional but Helpful

**[Hotel](https://booking.tpo.lv/2PT1kR82) Booking Confirmation**
While not required by the official portal, having a hotel reservation for your first few nights can strengthen your application. It shows immigration officials that you have concrete travel plans.

**Travel Insurance**
Not required for the e-visa itself, but highly recommended. We always travel with [travel insurance](https://go2-vietnam.com/travel-insurance/) in Vietnam—medical costs can be high, and accidents happen. Some insurers offer 24-hour coverage starting from the moment you purchase.

## 6. Common Application Mistakes to Avoid

During our years helping travelers, we've seen the same errors repeatedly. Here's how to avoid them:

### Passport Information Mismatches

The #1 reason for e-visa rejection: your name on the application doesn't match your passport exactly. If your passport says "JOHN MICHAEL SMITH" but you enter "John M. Smith," it will be rejected. Copy your name character-by-character from your passport. Same goes for date of birth—use the exact format shown in your passport.

### Poor Quality Passport Photo

A blurry, poorly lit, or off-center photo causes delays. The immigration system uses facial recognition, so your face must be clearly visible. If your first photo is rejected, you can resubmit, but this adds 24 hours to your processing time. Take the photo in natural daylight, facing the camera directly, with a plain white background.

### Incorrect Entry Port

Vietnam has multiple entry points: [Hanoi](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/hanoi/) (Noi Bai Airport), [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/) (Tan Son Nhat Airport), [Da Nang](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/da-nang/) (Da Nang Airport), land borders in the north, and seaports. You must specify where you're entering. If you're flying into [Hanoi](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/hanoi/) but list [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/) as your entry point, immigration may question you at the airport. Choose your actual entry location.

### Expired or Nearly-Expired Passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from your intended entry date. If your passport expires in 5 months, you won't be approved. Renew your passport before applying if it's close to expiration.

<div style="background:#FEF3C7;border-left:4px solid #F59E0B;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:12px;">
    <span style="font-size:28px;line-height:1;">💡</span>
    <div style="flex:1;">
      <strong style="font-size:18px;color:#92400E;display:block;margin-bottom:6px;">Pro Tip</strong>
      <p style="color:#78350F;margin:0;font-size:15px;line-height:1.5;">Print your e-visa approval email and the actual e-visa document. Don't rely solely on your phone—immigration officers at the airport need to see the printed version.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

---

## 7. After Approval: What Happens Next?

Once your e-visa is approved, you'll receive an email from the immigration portal with your approval notice and the e-visa document attached (usually as a PDF). Here's what to do:

### Print Your E-Visa

Print the e-visa on standard white A4 paper. Print both the approval letter and the visa document itself. Some travelers print two copies—one to carry and one as a backup. The document includes a barcode and QR code that immigration scans at the airport.

### Bring It to the Airport

On your travel day, pack the printed e-visa in an easily accessible part of your carry-on luggage. When you arrive at the airport in Vietnam, you'll go through immigration like normal. Hand the officer your passport and the printed e-visa. They'll scan the barcode, check your information, and stamp your passport. The entire process takes 2-3 minutes per person.

### What If Immigration Questions Your E-Visa?

In rare cases, an immigration officer might ask questions about your trip. This usually happens if your application had inconsistencies or if the officer is being extra cautious. Be honest: explain your travel plans, show your hotel booking, and remain calm. We've never seen a legitimate e-visa rejected at the airport if the application was approved.

### Can You Travel Before Approval?

No. Do not book your flight before your e-visa is approved. Apply first, wait for approval, then book your flight. The only exception is if you're using super-urgent processing and your flight is within 2 hours—but this is cutting it dangerously close.

---

## 8. Single-Entry vs. Multiple-Entry E-Visa: Which Should You Choose?

This decision depends on your travel plans:

### Single-Entry E-Visa (30 Days)


<div data-widget-fallback style="background:#EFF6FF;border-left:4px solid #3B82F6;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

    </a>
  </div>
</div>


**Best for**: First-time visitors, those spending 2-4 weeks in Vietnam, travelers not planning to leave and re-enter

**Cost**: 25 USD (normal), 50 USD (urgent), 100 USD (super-urgent)

**Validity**: 90 days from issue date; you can enter anytime within this window and stay for 30 days

A single-entry visa means you can enter Vietnam once and stay for up to 30 days. If you leave Vietnam (e.g., to visit [Cambodia](https://go2-vietnam.com/region/central-vietnam/) or Thailand) and want to return, you'll need a new visa.

### Multiple-Entry E-Visa (90 Days)

**Best for**: Digital nomads, business travelers, those planning to visit neighboring countries and return to Vietnam

**Cost**: 50 USD (normal), 100 USD (urgent), 150 USD (super-urgent)

**Validity**: 90 days from issue date; you can enter and exit Vietnam multiple times within this period, with each stay up to 30 days

A multiple-entry visa is more flexible. You can leave Vietnam, visit [Thailand](https://go2-vietnam.com/region/north-vietnam/) or [Cambodia](https://go2-vietnam.com/region/central-vietnam/), and return to Vietnam without needing a new visa—as long as you're within the 90-day validity window.

### Our Recommendation

For most first-time visitors, the **single-entry e-visa is sufficient and saves money**. If you're planning a longer Southeast Asia trip with multiple Vietnam visits, the multiple-entry visa is worth the extra 25 USD.

---

## 9. E-Visa Extensions and What to Do If You Need to Stay Longer

Here's the hard truth: **you cannot extend a Vietnam e-visa**. If you arrive on a single-entry e-visa and decide you want to stay longer than 30 days, you have two options:

### Option 1: Apply for a New Visa Before Your Current One Expires

Before your 30-day stay ends, you can apply for a new e-visa (or any other visa type) to extend your time in Vietnam. You'll need to leave Vietnam, get your passport stamped with an exit, then re-enter on the new visa. This works if you're on a multiple-entry visa or if you're willing to make a quick trip to a neighboring country.

### Option 2: Extend Your Stay Through Immigration (Temporary Residence Card)

Some travelers apply for a Temporary Residence Card (TRC) while in Vietnam. This is more complex and requires working with a local immigration service or travel agency. The process takes 3-5 days and costs 50-100 USD. During our time in [Ho Chi Minh City](https://go2-vietnam.com/city/ho-chi-minh-city/), we saw digital nomads use this method when they decided to stay longer than planned.

> **Did You Know?** Vietnam's e-visa system has a 99.2% approval rate for eligible applicants. Rejections are almost always due to incomplete information or document quality issues, not immigration policy.

## 10. Troubleshooting: What If Your E-Visa Application Is Rejected?

Rejections happen, but they're usually fixable. Here's what to do:

### Common Rejection Reasons

**Passport Information Mismatch**: Your name or date of birth doesn't match your passport exactly. Solution: Reapply with the correct information.

**Poor Photo Quality**: The system couldn't read your face clearly. Solution: Retake the photo in better lighting and resubmit.

**Invalid Passport**: Your passport is expired or expires within 6 months. Solution: Renew your passport and reapply.

**Incomplete Application**: You missed a required field. Solution: Review the rejection email for specifics and reapply with all information filled in.

### How to Reapply

If rejected, you can immediately submit a new application. There's no penalty or waiting period. Simply correct the issue and reapply. If you're close to your travel date and worried about processing time, choose urgent processing for the second attempt.

### When to Contact Support

If you've reapplied twice and keep getting rejected, contact the immigration portal's support team through the official website. Include your rejection emails and passport copy. Response times vary, but expect 24-48 hours. During our experience, the support team is helpful and responsive, though English proficiency varies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I apply for a Vietnam e-visa if I'm already in Vietnam?

No. The e-visa is for people applying from outside Vietnam. If you're already in the country and need to extend your stay, you must apply for a Temporary Residence Card or exit and re-enter with a new visa.

### What if I miss my flight after getting e-visa approval?

Your e-visa remains valid for 90 days from the issue date. You can use it anytime within that window. Simply book a new flight and travel on the same e-visa—no reapplication needed.

### Is the e-visa valid for the entire 90 days, or just for entry?

The 90-day validity is for entry only. Once you enter Vietnam and get your passport stamped, you can stay for 30 days (single-entry) or multiple 30-day periods (multiple-entry). After your stay ends, you must leave Vietnam or apply for a new visa.

### Can I apply for multiple e-visas at once?

Yes, you can have multiple e-visas active simultaneously. Some travelers apply for a second e-visa a few weeks before their first one expires, ensuring continuous coverage if they decide to stay longer.

### What if my passport details change between application and travel?

If you change your name or get a new passport, you'll need to reapply for a new e-visa. The e-visa is tied to your passport number, and immigration will cross-check this at the airport.

### Do I need travel insurance to get a Vietnam e-visa?

No, travel insurance is not required for the e-visa application. However, we strongly recommend purchasing it before your trip. Medical costs in Vietnam can be high, and insurance provides peace of mind.
