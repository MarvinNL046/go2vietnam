    "faq2Q": "Do I need a return ticket to enter Vietnam?",
    "faq2A": "Technically yes -- immigration may ask for proof of onward travel. Airlines are more likely to check this at boarding. Having a return or onward flight ticket (even a cheap one to a neighboring country) is recommended.",
    "faq3Q": "What if my e-visa application is rejected?",
    "faq3A": "E-visa rejections are rare but usually caused by poor-quality photos, mismatched passport information, or applicants from restricted countries. If rejected, the $25 fee is not refunded. Double-check all details and reapply, or consider visa on arrival as an alternative.",
    "faq4Q": "Can Americans get a visa exemption?",
    "faq4A": "No. US citizens currently need either an e-visa or visa on arrival. The e-visa ($25, 90 days) is the simplest option for American travelers."
