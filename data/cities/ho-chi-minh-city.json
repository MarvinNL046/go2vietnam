  "description": { "en": "Vietnam's largest and most dynamic city pulses with energy from dawn to well past midnight. Known locally as Saigon, this southern metropolis offers world-class street food, sobering war history museums, French colonial landmarks, and a booming modern skyline that rivals any Southeast Asian capital." },
  "overview": "Ho Chi Minh City — still universally called Saigon by locals — is Vietnam's economic engine and largest city, home to over 9 million people (13 million in the greater metropolitan area). Originally a small Khmer fishing village, it became the capital of French Cochinchina in the 1860s and later the capital of South Vietnam. After reunification in 1975, it was renamed Ho Chi Minh City, though the name Saigon endures in everyday conversation and even on the city's airport code (SGN). Today the city is a study in contrasts: century-old pagodas stand in the shadow of glass skyscrapers, street vendors with bamboo shoulder poles navigate between luxury SUVs, and serene Buddhist temples sit just blocks from thumping rooftop bars. The energy is relentless, the food scene is extraordinary, and the war history sites are deeply moving. District 1 is the historic heart, but neighborhoods like District 3, Binh Thanh, and Thu Duc (formerly District 2/Thao Dien) each offer distinct personalities.",

It serves as Vietnam's busiest airport with direct flights to major cities across Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America. A Grab car to District 1 costs approximately 100,000-150,000 VND ($4-6) and takes 20-45 minutes depending on traffic. The airport bus (route 109) runs to the city center for 20,000 VND ($0.80). Metered taxis from official stands cost similar to Grab.",

Trains run daily to Nha Trang (7-9 hours), Da Nang (17-20 hours), Hue (19-22 hours), and Hanoi (30-34 hours). Sleeper berths are recommended for overnight journeys.

  "gettingAround": "Grab is the dominant ride-hailing app and the most convenient way to get around. Grab Bike rides within central Saigon cost 15,000-30,000 VND ($0.60-1.20), while Grab Car rides are typically 30,000-80,000 VND ($1.20-3.20) within the center. The new Metro Line 1 (Ben Thanh to Suoi Tien) opened in late 2024, connecting District 1 to Thu Duc. City buses cover major routes for 6,000-7,000 VND but are slow in traffic. Walking is practical within districts but crossing between districts on foot is challenging due to distances and heat. Renting a motorbike is popular but Saigon traffic is intense — experienced riders only.",

Come for the atmosphere and food court rather than bargain shopping (prices are inflated for tourists — start negotiations at 40-50% of the asking price). At night, the surrounding streets transform into a busy night market with street food stalls."

  "safety": "Ho Chi Minh City is generally safe for tourists, but petty crime is more common than in other Vietnamese cities. Bag snatching by motorbike riders is the primary risk — always carry bags on the side away from the road, use a cross-body bag, and be vigilant when walking near traffic. Phone snatching while sitting at street-side cafes is also reported. Avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics unnecessarily. The Bui Vien backpacker area can be rowdy late at night. Traffic is the biggest genuine danger — cross streets cautiously using the same slow-and-steady technique as in Hanoi. Use Grab rather than flagging down random motorbike taxis. Tap water is not safe to drink.",

    "Visit the War Remnants Museum early in the morning to avoid large tour groups and give yourself emotional processing time.",
    "The best banh mi in the city is widely considered to be Banh Mi Huynh Hoa (26 Le Thi Rieng, District 1) — expect a queue, especially between 3-6pm.",
    "Take the Metro Line 1 to experience Saigon's modern infrastructure — it runs from Ben Thanh Market to the eastern suburbs.",
    "For a break from the city heat, head to a cafe with air conditioning — The Workshop Coffee (District 1) and Okkio Caffe (District 3) are excellent choices."
