  "overview": "Nha Trang is Vietnam's premier beach resort city, centered on a sweeping 6km crescent of golden sand framed by green mountains and dotted with offshore islands. Located in Khanh Hoa Province on the south-central coast, the city has a population of roughly 500,000 and has been a popular beach destination since the French colonial era. The clear, warm waters of Nha Trang Bay are home to some of Vietnam's best coral reefs, making it the country's diving capital. Beyond the beach, the city has genuine historical depth: the Po Nagar Cham Towers, built between the 7th and 12th centuries, are among the best-preserved Cham religious sites in Vietnam. The Long Son Pagoda with its massive white Buddha sits atop a hill overlooking the city. In recent years, Nha Trang has seen rapid development with large-scale resort projects, amusement parks, and a growing Russian and Chinese tourist presence that has reshaped parts of the city center. Despite this, the beachfront remains beautiful, the seafood is excellent and affordable, and the surrounding islands offer pristine escapes from the resort strip.",

  "safety": "Nha Trang is generally safe but has more petty crime reports than smaller Vietnamese cities due to its resort-town nature.
